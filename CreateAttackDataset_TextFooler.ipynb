    "This notebook implements the <b>TextFooler</b> attack on the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) 2.0 dataset.<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to create adversarial examples for question-answering systems using the TextFooler method. It replaces words with synonyms while preserving the overall structure and meaning of the text. The attack targets words based on their part of speech, avoiding modification of certain grammatical elements to maintain readability.<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated adversarial examples are designed to challenge question-answering models by introducing subtle word-level changes that may affect the model's performance without significantly altering the human-readable content. This approach allows for testing the robustness of QA models against lexical variations while keeping the core information intact.<br /><br />\n",
